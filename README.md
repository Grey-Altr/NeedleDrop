## Development Guide & Pseudocode

### Notes:
- All work will be done on a `dev` branch.
- Merges to `main` will be committed after testing each specific functionality.
- Final merge to `main` will occur prior to project submission and presentation.

### 0. Web Design Planning (Figma)
- [ ] Create a new Figma project: "NeedleDrop UI"
- [ ] Define the visual theme (colors, fonts, spacing, branding)
- [ ] Sketch a wireframe for each major page:
  - [ ] Home / Landing page
  - [ ] Login/Register
  - [ ] Release List & Detail Page
  - [ ] Collection Dashboard
  - [ ] Wishlist Page
  - [ ] Review Section / Form
- [ ] Use Frames to define layout using Flexbox-style or grid layout
- [ ] Label all components: buttons, navbars, cards, inputs, etc.
- [ ] Group reusable UI elements (e.g. release cards, review blocks)
- [ ] Define color palette and check accessibility contrast
- [ ] Export or screenshot key screens for use in documentation
- [ ] (Optional) Share Figma link in README for visual reference

### 1. Project & Git Setup
- [ ] Create GitHub repo: `needledrop`
- [ ] Clone locally
- [ ] Create and switch to `dev` branch
- [ ] Initialize Django project: `django-admin startproject needledrop`
- [ ] Create app: `python manage.py startapp collection`
- [ ] Install psycopg2 and create PostgreSQL DB
- [ ] Connect PostgreSQL in `settings.py`
- [ ] Run `migrate` and create superuser

### 2. Models & Relationships
- [ ] Define models:
  - [ ] Artist: name, genre, bio
  - [ ] Release: title, FK to Artist, format, release_date, cover_image, description
  - [ ] CollectionEntry: FK to User + Release, condition, owned_since, notes, is_for_sale
  - [ ] WishListItem: FK to User + Release, priority, note, added_at
  - [ ] Review: FK to User + Release, rating, review_text, created_at
- [ ] Run `makemigrations` and `migrate`
- [ ] Register all models in `admin.py`

### 3. Authentication
- [ ] Enable login, logout, and register functionality
- [ ] Create views/templates for authentication
- [ ] Use `@login_required` on collection, wishlist, review views
- [ ] Use `{% if request.user.is_authenticated %}` to control access in templates

### 4. Templates & Base Layout
- [ ] Create `base.html` with nav links:
  - Home | My Collection | My Wishlist | My Reviews | Login | Logout
- [ ] Use `{% block content %}` and extend `base.html` in all views
- [ ] Create templates for:
  - [ ] Artist list/detail
  - [ ] Release list/detail

### 5. CollectionEntry CRUD
- [ ] Create view to list user's collection entries
- [ ] Create form to add a release to user's collection
- [ ] Create form to edit collection details (condition, notes, for sale)
- [ ] Create view to delete collection entry
- [ ] Restrict edit/delete buttons to `entry.user == request.user`

### 6. WishListItem CRUD
- [ ] Create wishlist view for current user
- [ ] Create form to add release to wishlist (with priority and note)
- [ ] Create option to remove from wishlist
- [ ] Prevent duplicate wishlist entries (enforce `unique_together`)
- [ ] Add "Add to Wishlist" button to release detail page

### 7. Review CRUD
- [ ] Create review form (rating and optional text)
- [ ] Show user's review on release detail page
- [ ] Prevent multiple reviews per user per release (unique constraint)
- [ ] Create views to edit and delete reviews
- [ ] Display average rating on each release detail page

### 8. Unit Tests
- [ ] Create `tests.py` file
- [ ] Write model tests for Review:
  - [ ] Creation
  - [ ] Uniqueness
  - [ ] Rating value
- [ ] Write model tests for WishListItem:
  - [ ] Creation
  - [ ] Default priority
  - [ ] Uniqueness
- [ ] Run tests with `python manage.py test`

### 9. Final Polish
- [ ] Ensure consistent template layout across pages
- [ ] Add alt text for all cover images
- [ ] Style all buttons and forms using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- [ ] Ensure text contrast meets accessibility standards (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Remove unused or commented-out code

### 10. Deployment & Submission
- [ ] Set up production config for Render/Railway
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and collect static files
- [ ] Deploy app to hosting platform
- [ ] Finalize `README.md`:
  - [ ] Screenshot
  - [ ] Live app link
  - [ ] User stories
  - [ ] Technologies used
  - [ ] Development schedule
  - [ ] ERD diagram
- [ ] Merge `dev` branch into `main`
- [ ] Push final code and tag submission commit
- [ ] Submit repo and live link

### 11. Presentation Prep
- [ ] Prepare presentation walkthrough:
  - [ ] What the app does
  - [ ] How it works (models, views, templates)
  - [ ] Key features
  - [ ] Challenges you solved
  - [ ] What you'd add with more time
